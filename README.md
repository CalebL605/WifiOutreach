# Wifi Outreach

## Description

Many underprivileged, low-income towns in the United States don't have access to fast reliable wifi. There is also competition between cell providers to provide 5G to consumers. The solution is to offset the cost of the distribution of 5G towers by providing low cost wifi to low-income areas in the United States.
